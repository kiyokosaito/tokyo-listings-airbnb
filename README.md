This repo is for project for Programming for Data Analysis, deadline is 13th Dec, 2019

This project's jupyter notebook is for project for Programming for Data Analysis, deadline is 13th December, 2019.

As I am working for Airbnb, I am curious to see if there are any relationships between data that we have on our system. I chose the database that gathered Airbnb host's listings in Tokyo which contains many variables. The aim of this project is to investigate the datasets to discuss what I found with the data set.
I adapted the database from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

There are so many variables in this data set. I picked 4 variables below in this project to investigate further.

1.room_type, 2.price, 3.number_of_reviews, 4.calculated_host_listings_count.

Airbnb is a marketplace which heavily depends on user reviews. It is very important to get good reviews for our hosts to promote their booking. I picked 4 variables above to see if there any relationships between 4 variables.

Tomorrow, I will import dataset with 4 variables ad df, choose 100 samples randamly, take avarage price, number of reviews and calculated host listing count on each room types(3 types) and see what distribution is the best or not and create some plot, to see the relationship between the data.(2nd part)

Then synthesise/simulate a data set (3rd part)then give a conclusion of the project. (4th part)
