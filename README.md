# Fidnding the best category of listing and price range to gain reviews in Tokyo Airbnb listings to promote host's earnings opportunity

########This repo is for project for Programming for Data Analysis, deadline is 16th Dec, 2019.

## Introduction

As I am working for Airbnb, I am curious to see if there are any relationships between data that we have on our system. I chose the database that gathered Airbnb host's listings in Tokyo which contains many variables which Date Compiled was on 28 September, 2019. The aim of this project is to investigate the datasets to discuss what I found with the data set.

Airbnb is a marketplace which heavily depends on user reviews. It is very important to get good reviews for our hosts to promote their booking.

Getting more reviews would promote more earnings for our hosts because;
      -potential guests would know more accurate description of the listing apart from the listing page
      -build more trust on hosting standard
      -it would lead to our Superhost program which would give more benefitial features on our platform
      
Above factors would promote our hosts more earnings on our platform. I'll analyze existing data about hosts in Tokyo to find the best category and price range to gain reviews on their listing. To make my recommendation, I'll try to find out:

What is the best category for our hosts to receive more reviews.
Is there any relationship between price and receiving reviews.
What is the best minimum nights setting for our hosts to get more reveiws.

I adapted the database from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

There are so many variables in this data set. I picked 4 variables below in this project to investigate further.

1.room_type, 2.price, 3.minimum_nights 4.number_of_reviews, 5.calculated_host_listings_count.

1.There are 3 types of room types. +Entire house, +Private room, +Shared room
2.Price per night of the listing
3.Minimum nights stay setting
4.Total of reviews that host earned
5.Total of listings that host published on our platform

## Summary of Results


## Exploring Existing Data



Tomorrow, I will import dataset with 4 variables ad df, choose 100 samples randamly, take avarage price, number of reviews and calculated host listing count on each room types(3 types) and see what distribution is the best or not and create some plot, to see the relationship between the data.(2nd part)

Then synthesise/simulate a data set (3rd part)then give a conclusion of the project. (4th part)
